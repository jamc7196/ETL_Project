ETL Project: Fifa World Cup Database Project


Report


1) Extraction

The data was collected from the site Kaggle, where it came in three different CSV files.

- Link: https://www.kaggle.com/pavanraj159/fifa-world-cup-1930-to-2014-data-analysis/data

- Data sources:
	* World Cups History: CSV file with all the history of the winneres and runners up of all the tournments celebrated in 1930-2014
	* World Cups Matches: CSV file containing all the game data generated in the tournamentes
	* World Cup Players: CSV file containing all the rosters of all the nationalities that were participant in the tournaments.

After inspecting the information thoroughly, we decided to use a relational database because the tables had corresponding data between each other; PostgreSQL was the go-to tool.
We created an ERD diagram to make the relation visualizations easier, which led us to divide the information into 9 sets that were to be uploaded as 9 tables in the database.


2) Transformation:

To make the database creation easier, the three data CSV's were uploaded to pandas, transformed using merges, drops, renames, concatenations and more.
These transformations led to the creation of the desired 9 CSV's with the following names:

- cups
- country
- coaches
- matches
- referees
- events
- players
- rosters
- participants

 
Complications

Many rows were duplicated.
Some countries needed to be renamed as it changed name (such as th Federal Republic of Germany, which is now called just Germany).
Some data that came in columns needed to be placed as labels, like the referee status (Referee, Assistant 1 or Assistant 2).
Some event information came double, triple and even cuadruple in a single column, so it had to be split and then concatenated.


3) Load

The table structures were created using the query tool, and then the information was uploaded using the previously made CSV files.
The schema is in the file named Tables.
